  <h1>Project proposal: Trip Planner</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
    <p>
      Traveling is an exhilarating adventure into the uncharted territories which satisfies our instinctive
       urge to explore new places, taste unfamiliar foods and embrace change.
       There are various reasons why we may embark on a trip, but any perfect journey
        is difficult to achieve without thorough trip planning. A well-crafted travel 
        plan helps maximize the experience of a trip by identifying the ideal sights, 
        restaurants, and activities, as well as planning time and budget more 
        efficiently. However, developing a well-thought-out plan always requires 
        significant effort. According to <a href="https://www.travelagentcentral.com/running-your-business/stats-stress-causing-37-percent-travelers-to-cancel-or-delay-vacation#:~:text=Too%20many%20choices%3A%20Two%20in,to%20do%20during%20their%20trip.">a survey conducted by Wyndham Vacation Rentals</a> 
        , more than half of U.S. vacationers say they have experienced an
        increase in travel stress over the past year, with 67 percent experiencing 
        stress due to "information overload" and 41 percent experiencing stress due 
        to scheduling things to do during their trip.Travelers are often overwhelmed
         by the abundance of choices of sights and dining options.The variety of 
         decisions and differences between choices could also leave travelers with 
         fatigue and anxiety and makes trip planning challenging. 
    </p>  
    <p>
         Although there are plenty of travel guides available on the internet, the accuracy and 
          reliability of the information in the guides requires extra time and 
          effort to verify. Generic travel guides are credible but lack 
          personalization, leaving travelers to put extra effort into planning 
          their trips on their own conditions. The existing application <a href="https://www.tripit.com/app/trips">Tripit</a>, 
          while enabling the creation of personalized travel plans, 
          lacks descriptions of activities and comparisons between programs 
          and scenarios. In order to optimize the trip planning process, our
           application would help users build personalized trip plans in a more 
           convenient way.

    <p>
      Users of the travel planning application will have access to a wide range of information to aid them in crafting their personalized trip plans. 
      This information includes detailed descriptions of activities, attractions, and points of interest at each destination, 
      encompassing essential details such as opening hours, or admission fees, if any. 
      Additionally, users can explore comparisons between different activities, tours, 
      and accommodations to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget. 
      The app will also provide practical information such as transportation options, 
      and weather forecasts to help users plan their trips effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed travel planning application would like to offer a solution to the common challenge faced by travelers: 
      the time-consuming process of sifting through generic travel guides to create personalized itineraries. 
      By integrating features such as personalization, detailed activity schedules, and comparisons between options, 
      the app streamlines the trip planning process, saving users valuable time and effort. 
      With personalized trip plans generated based on users' preferences and constraints, 
      travelers can easily discover activities and attractions tailored to their interests, 
      ensuring a more fulfilling and enjoyable travel experience.
