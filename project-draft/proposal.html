    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
    <p>
      Traveling is an exhilarating adventure into the uncharted territories which satisfies our instinctive
      urge to explore new places, taste unfamiliar foods and embrace change.
      There are various reasons why we may embark on a trip, but any perfect journey
      is difficult to achieve without thorough trip planning. A well-crafted travel
      plan helps maximize the experience of a trip by identifying the ideal sights,
      restaurants, and activities, as well as planning time and budget more
      efficiently. However, developing a well-thought-out plan always requires
      significant effort. According to <a
        href="https://www.travelagentcentral.com/running-your-business/stats-stress-causing-37-percent-travelers-to-cancel-or-delay-vacation#:~:text=Too%20many%20choices%3A%20Two%20in,to%20do%20during%20their%20trip.">a
        survey conducted by Wyndham Vacation Rentals</a>
      , more than half of U.S. vacationers say they have experienced an
      increase in travel stress over the past year, with 67 percent experiencing
      stress due to "information overload" and 41 percent experiencing stress due
      to scheduling things to do during their trip.Travelers are often overwhelmed
      by the abundance of choices of sights and dining options.The variety of
      decisions and differences between choices could also leave travelers with
      fatigue and anxiety and makes trip planning challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there are plenty of travel guides available on the internet, the accuracy and
      reliability of the information in the guides requires extra time and
      effort to verify. Generic travel guides are credible but lack
      personalization, leaving travelers to put extra effort into planning
      their trips on their own conditions. The existing application <a
        href="https://www.tripit.com/app/trips">Tripit</a>,
      while enabling the creation of personalized travel plans,
      lacks descriptions of activities and comparisons between programs
      and scenarios. In order to optimize the trip planning process, our
      application would help users build personalized trip plans in a more
      convenient way.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>
      The main users of the application are different kinds of travelers(family, adventure, etc).
      We are trying to make the website more user-friendly for all users who want to plan their trips and get the
      estimated cost.
      We will also help travelers who are under a certain budget, these travelers are looking to travel affordably,
      seeking the best deals on accommodations, and experience.
      The users will use the app to plan out the trip. We have included some features for our users to have a better
      understanding and experience.
    <p>
      The first one is a customized trip planning tool. This feature allows users to create personalized travel
      itineraries based on their interests, budget, and duration of stay.
      Users can input their travel dates, preferred activities (such as cultural experiences, adventure sports, dining
      preferences), budget range, and any specific destinations they're interested in.
      The app then uses this information to suggest a detailed itinerary, including flights, accommodations, and daily
      activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second feature is real time cost estimation and budget tracker, this feature help users to have an estimate of
      cost for their entire trip, including accommodations, activity.
      It collects prices from various sources to offer the best deals and options. Users can check on the real time
      budget as theyâ€™re approaching their budget.
      The half feature is going to be community drive recommendations. This is a social feature where users can share
      their experiences, post their reviews, and give suggestions to other users.

    </p>

    <p>
      Users of the travel planning application will have access to a wide range of information to aid them in crafting
      their personalized trip plans.
      This information includes detailed descriptions of activities, attractions, and points of interest at each
      destination,
      encompassing essential details such as opening hours, or admission fees, if any.
      Additionally, users can explore comparisons between different activities, tours,
      and accommodations to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.
      The app will also provide practical information such as transportation options,
      and weather forecasts to help users plan their trips effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed travel planning application would like to offer a solution to the common challenge faced by
      travelers:
      the time-consuming process of sifting through generic travel guides to create personalized itineraries.
      By integrating features such as personalization, detailed activity schedules, and comparisons between options,
      the app streamlines the trip planning process, saving users valuable time and effort.
      With personalized trip plans generated based on users' preferences and constraints,
      travelers can easily discover activities and attractions tailored to their interests,
      ensuring a more fulfilling and enjoyable travel experience.
